NOTE: The live preview on github pages does not currently work. If you still want to see the project in action then please download the repository and either open the folder in your command line application or open  it with a code editor that has built in command line and then enter the following command to start a local preview: `npm start`.

I am working on getting the GH Pages version functional and will update this readme as soon as I have done so.

Thank you.
